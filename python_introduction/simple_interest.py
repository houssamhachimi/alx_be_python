# Define variables
principal = 1000  # Initial investment amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Output the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
